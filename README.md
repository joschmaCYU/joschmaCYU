## 🤔 Who I am and where I come from  
- I am a Franco-German dual degree student in Engineering & Design at CY Tech in France, who likes to code during his free time😉  
#### 🤩 <ins>My beginnings</ins>
- My passion for coding started early, at the age of 12 (2017). My first experience was **HTML/PHP/CSS**. After that, I quickly switched to developing games with **Unity** in **C#**. I loved it so much that I decided to attend the Isart [summer school](https://www.isart.fr/summer-school/code-jeu-video-2d/) during which I have developed my first video game. Then, I experienced more with games but felt quickly bored and wanted to learn new things... but didn't really know what! I was young and liked playing games more than making some. Lockdown offered a lot of free time and it’s when I started diving deeply into serious programming. 
#### ⛏🧱 <ins>Minecraft</ins>
- One day as I was playing **Minecraft**, I noticed a group of gamers looking for a programmer to work on their server (if you don't know what a server is, it's a place where people can play together) and thought to myself “I already know how to code in C#, it will be easy for me to learn Java”. And that's how I joined [Helvetis](http://play.helvetis.net/helvetis/index.html)
#### 🥰 <ins>Helvetis</ins>
- I joined this project at the beginning of may 2020 and it's still going on! 😄  
- In this team, we are 5: Wrench: the system admin; Koordan: the builder; Sweet: the organizer; Clim: the modarator; and me: the developer!  
- Our goal with this server is to attract as many players as possible.
- After joining this project I quickly became **Administrator**. The experience of meeting people randomly on the internet and creating a team project without knowing them at all is still stunning for me. This made me learn not only how to attract players but also gave me the role of a professional programmer and community manager.  
- Throughout these years I have met a lot of gamers from all over the world. Without this project none of these encounters could have been possible. Some were nice some not so...  
- Helvetis really means a lot to me. And these 4 strangers quickly became my online family. We were so close that we even met in real life! 🥳  
- Thanks to this project, I learned Java and discovered the **Spigot** library. I also learned **SQL** and how to manage databases.

- SpigotMC is a forum around Minecraft, where you can find many plugins (a plugin is an original game extension)  
- On this forum I [sold](https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/colsed-experienced-developer-affordable-easy-to-use-fully-configurable-plugins.517832/) on-demand plugins
- Now, I am selling a Block Party plugin for 19.99€ and I have sold approximately 70. Here is my online store:

#### 📟 <ins>Embedded System</ins>
- I am learning embedded system with a Raspberry Pi Pico in rust!

#### 🏖️ <ins>New horizons</ins>
- After developing mostly in **Java** for more that 2 years, I wanted to experience new things! And started to develop small personal modules in **Go, AI, Assembly Language, C, Embedded systems, Rust**.
