  <summary><h2>📦 All My Projects & Story (Click to Expand)</h2></summary>
  <h3>My beginnings (2017)</h3>
  <p>
    My passion for coding started early, at the age of 12 (2017). My first experience was <b>HTML/PHP/CSS</b>.<br>
    After that, I quickly switched to developing games with <b>Unity</b> in <b>C#</b>. I loved it so much that I decided to attend the Isart
    <a href="https://www.isart.fr/summer-school/code-jeu-video-2d/">summer school</a> during which I have developed my first video game.
    Then, I experienced more with games but felt quickly bored and wanted to learn new things... but didn't really know what! I was young and liked
    playing games more than making some.
  </p>

  <h4>⛏ <ins>Minecraft</ins></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      One day as I was playing <strong>Minecraft</strong>, I noticed a group of gamers looking for a programmer to work on their server (if you don't
      know what a server is, it's a place where people can play together) and thought to myself “I already know how to code in C#, it will be easy for
      me to learn Java”. And that's how I joined <a href="http://play.helvetis.net/helvetis/index.html">Helvetis</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>⛏ <ins>Helvetis (2020 - 2023)</ins></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I joined this project at the beginning of may 2020 to 2023</li>
    <li>In this team, we where 5: Wrench: the system admin; Koordan: the builder; Sweet: the organizer; Clim: the modarator; and me: the developer!</li>
    <li>Our goal with this server is to attract as many players as possible.</li>
    <li>
      After joining this project I quickly became <strong>Administrator</strong>. The experience of meeting people randomly on the internet and creating a
      team project without knowing them at all is still stunning for me. This made me learn not only how to attract players but also gave me the role
      of a professional programmer and community manager.
    </li>
    <li>
      Throughout these years I have met a lot of gamers from all over the world. Without this project none of these encounters could have been
      possible. Some were nice some not so...
    </li>
    <li>
      Helvetis really means a lot to me. And these 4 strangers quickly became my online family. We were so close that we even met in real life! 🥳
    </li>
    <li>
      Thanks to this project, I learned Java and discovered the <strong>Spigot</strong> library. I also learned <strong>SQL</strong> and how to manage
      databases.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>SpigotMC is a forum around Minecraft, where you can find many plugins (a plugin is an original game extension)</li>
    <li>
      On this forum I
      <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/threads/colsed-experienced-developer-affordable-easy-to-use-fully-configurable-plugins.517832/">sold</a>
      on-demand plugins
    </li>
    <li>
      Now, I am selling a Block Party plugin for 19.99€ and I have sold around 200 copies. Here is my online store:

    <li>
      Since jully 2024 the plugin is community
      <a href="https://github.com/joschmaCYU/-YMA-BlockParty/">maintened</a>. It was a real blast to work on this project for less then 2 years but I
      wanted to do some new things!

  <h3><ins>New horizons</ins></h3>
  <p>
    After developing mostly in <strong>Java</strong> for more that 4 years, I wanted to experience new things! And started to develop small personal
    modules in <strong>Go, AI, Assembly Language, C, Embedded systems, Rust</strong>.

  <h3><ins>Robotcraft at Ingeniarus: Robotics (Summer 2023)</ins></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      During 2 month I attented <a href="https://robotcraft.ingeniarius.pt/">robotcraft</a> and completed, the 2024 Summer Internship at Ingeniarus.
    </li>
    <li>
      I learned a lot but most notably <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> which we used extensively in c++. If I had to describe what ROS is it's
      like whatsapp you can create chat group where people can post information or listen to information. This let's us create very complex systems.
      You can find the code that I made in ROS <a href="https://github.com/joschmaCYU/ROS">here</a>.
    </li>
    <li>This is the <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/SXlsa0vp95U?feature=share">robot</a> that we used</li>
    <li>At the end we had to resolve a maze with our <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/XMeQIIvutdI">robot</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3><ins>CY école de design / CY Tech (2023 - 2029)</ins></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I am currently studing at Cy école de design, in a dual degree student in Engineering & Design at CY Tech in France.</li>
    <li>
      I created my own none profit with my friend Alann,
      <a href="https://linktr.ee/clubcybotics"><strong>CyBotics</strong></a> !
      We have specialized our selves in robotics and participated for our first year at the
      <a href="https://www.coupederobotique.fr/">coupe de France de robotique</a> where we had to build a robot that moves wood plank on top of bean
      cans. This cup was where impressive for ous. We where just two student that never participated and managed to homologate our robot which is not
      given for a first timer. Other teams (which are 15 people on averadge) where very cool and we talk and learned a lot of new things !
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3><ins>Robotic French Cup - Coupe de France de robotique (2025)</ins></h3>
  <p>
    As part of CyBotics, the robotics association I co-founded, I designed and developed autonomous robots to compete in the Coupe de France de
    Robotique 2025 (French Robotics Cup). Our goal was to build fully autonomous robots capable of completing complex tasks on a themed arena within
    100 seconds, without any human intervention.
  </p>

  <p>My main contributions included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Embedded software development in C++ and Arduino, focusing on motor control, sensor fusion, and autonomous decision-making.</li>
    <li>Integration of encoder feedback for precise motion control and odometry.</li>
    <li>ROS-based simulation and testing, optimizing algorithms before hardware deployment.</li>
    <li>Mechanical and electronic integration, collaborating closely with design and electrical teams.</li>
    <li>Strategic behavior design, implementing task sequencing and collision avoidance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This project involved the full development cycle — from prototyping and electronics assembly to software optimization and field testing —
    combining teamwork, systems engineering, and innovation under real competition constraints.
